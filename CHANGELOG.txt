Windows Alpha Release 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello! After 6 months of active work (actually no, I personally was
not actively working on Musializer during those 6 months, I have
shedton of other projects to worry about, sorry :D) we finally shipped
the Second Alpha Release on Windows! \o/

In this release we focused on adding proper UI that will eventually
tie together an ability to render specific local files that you
Drag&Drop on the window and recording from your microphone and
speakers (which is not available yet but we hope to deliver it in the
forthcoming releases).

Here are the notable changes:

- Added timeline. Now you can jump to any place of the song during
  the preview.

- Multiple Files Support: all the Drag&Drop-ed files are preserved
  and you can switch between them.

- Added master Volume Control. It controls the volume during the
  preview. It does not affect the audio of the final rendered video.

- Added a Fullscreen Button that hides all of the controls introduced
  recently to enable people using Musializer a backdrop for
  screenshots, videos, etc.

- Added a Play Button to pause/unpause the previewed song.

- Added a Render Button to start rendering. IMPORTANT! The shortcut
  for Rendering is now R, not F!

- Fixed crash on Windows 7 when rendering the video

Windows Alpha Release 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello! This is the first ever Alpha Release of Musializer on Windows!

- Double-click musializer.exe. It's not signed or anything cause I
  don't know how to do that. So Windows may freak out about that a
  bit. You just have to believe me that I didn't put in viruses in
  here. At least intentionally...

- Drag&Drop some music onto the window. Not all formats are supported,
  so some files could be rejected.

- Press Space to Pause/Unpause.

- Press F to render the video. It creates output.mp4 in the same
  folder as musializer.exe. Keep in mind that it can take some time.

- If you need to check the logs use musializer-logged.bat instead of
  musializer.exe. It generated log.txt file which contains the logs.

- Don't expect too much from this application! It's not even Beta yet!

- The full source code is available at
  https://github.com/tsoding/musializer

- Have fun!

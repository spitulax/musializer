The project aims to make a tool for creating beautiful music visualizations and rendering high quality videos of them.

## Build from Source

External Dependencies:
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) executable available in `PATH` environment variable. It is called as a child process during the rendering of the videos. So if you don't plan to render any videos it's completely **optional**.

We are using Custom Build System written entirely in C called `nob`. It is similar to [nobuild](https://github.com/tsoding/nobuild) in spirit. [nob.h](./src/nob.h) is the Build System and [nob.c](./nob.c) is the program that builds Musializer.

Before using `nob` you need to bootstrap it. Just compile it with the available C compiler. On Linux it's usually `$ cc -o nob nob.c` on Windows with MSVC from within `vcvarsall.bat` it's `$ cl.exe nob.c`. You only need to boostrap it once. After the bootstrap you can just keep running the same executable over and over again. It even tries to rebuild itself if you modify [nob.c](./nob.c) (which may fail sometimes, so in that case be ready to reboostrap it).

I really recommend to read [nob.c](./nob.c) and [nob.h](./src/nob.h) to get an idea of how it all actually works. The Build System is a work in progress, so if something breaks be ready to dive into it.

### Nix (x86_64 Linux)

```console
# Building musializer
$ nix build
# Running the dev shell
$ nix develop
```

### Linux and OpenBSD

```console
$ cc -o nob nob.c # ONLY ONCE!!!
$ ./nob
$ ./build/musializer
```

Keep in mind that the application needs [./resources/](./resources/) to be present in the folder it is ran from.

If the build fails because of missing header files, you may need to install the X11 dev packages.

On Debian, Ubuntu, etc, do this:

```console
$ sudo apt install libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev
```

On other distro's, use the appropriate package manager.

### Windows MSVC

From within `vcvarsall.bat` do

```console
> cl.exe nob.c # ONLY ONCE!!!
> nob.exe
> build\musializer.exe
```

### Cross Compilation from Linux to Windows using MinGW-w64

Install [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) from your distro repository.

Edit `./build/config.h` and set `MUSIALIZER_TARGET` to `TARGET_WIN64_MINGW`.

```console
$ ./nob
$ wine ./build/musializer.exe
```

## Hot Reloading

Edit `./build/config.h` and enable `MUSIALIZER_HOTRELOAD`.

```console
$ ./nob
$ ./build/musializer
```

Keep the app running. Rebuild with `./nob`. Hot reload by focusing on the window of the app and pressing <kbd>h</kbd>.

The way it works is by putting the majority of the logic of the application into a `libplug` dynamic library and just reloading it when requested. The [rpath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rpath) (aka hard-coded run-time search path) for that library is set to `.` and `./build/`. See [src/nob_linux.c](src/nob_linux.c) for more information on how everything is configured.
